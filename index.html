    <p>I went to the M&M store and got a few things
      from there: some socks, a bag full of M&Ms, and a dispenser.
      I also saw some stuff like cups, shirts, other dispensers etc.
      The weirdest dispenser to me (not to my mom she thinks it's cool)
      is the dragon costume from Chinese New Year (at least I think it
      could be).
      My most favorite part about M&M's is
      the game that they put, at the end
      of the game, you get a photo!
      The 4th floor was the cool one.
      It's cool because there is a place you can
      take a picture with the M&M statues there.
      In oreder to go to higher floors, we need to take the escalators.
      The only way to go out is the bottom floor.
      There were so much M&Ms at the place where
      you can get your own bag full of M&Ms.
      Thanks so much for seeing the world of M&Ms with me!</p>
